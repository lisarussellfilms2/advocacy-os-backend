# advocacy-os-backend

Cloud-native AI agent architecture powering ArtsEnvoy.ai.

## From Policy to Impact

Advocacy OS transforms institutional policy and campaign briefs into structured narrative systems that generate deployable campaign assets at scale.

## Overview

This repository contains the modular backend structure for an AI-native advocacy production system.

The system translates:

Policy Input → Narrative Blueprint → Campaign Assets

Built as a scalable API-first architecture for institutional deployment.
